# ADDING A LIST

### USER STORY
As a user I should be able to create a list with a custom title. Number of created lists is not limited. Title length should not exceed 50 characters. 
Application should block possibility to enter more signs. After clicking â€˜addâ€™ button I should be able to see the list on the screen. 
The created list should appear on the screen as columns. The button that allows you to add a list should move to the next column in the right direction. 
In the top right corner of the list there should be a button that allows you to delete the list. It should be possible to change the title of created list. 
Within the created list I should be able to create the tasks. It should not be possible to add two lists with the same name.
