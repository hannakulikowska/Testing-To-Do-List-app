# ADDING A TASK

### USER STORY

As a user, I should be able to add as many tasks to the list as I want. 
To create task I need to pass title and description. Both fields are required. 
Title input field should be limited to 100 characters. 
Description input field should be limited to 200 characters. 
After clicking 'Add task' button, I should see new task added to the list. 
It should not be possible to add two tasks with the same name.
